But at the same time an overly intimate thing to be doing with people who are often strangers. And since covid and our collective preoccupation with hand washing etc. it really does seem an odd thing to be doing. There's also this idea that some people think they can make meaningful judgements of another based on their handshake which is more or less nonsense (it's not going to tell you anything a couple of minutes in their company won't tell you) which makes the experience a bit anxiety inducing. And i often get clammy hands, as in this case, which I don't want to be sharing with others.	.	4	4	8	3	2	8	3		7		9	In an office, initially sitting but standing up for the handshake	A little	A little	Not at all	Not at all	Moderately	Not at all	A little	A little	A little	Not at all	Quite a bit	A little	Not at all	A little	A little	Not at all	A little	A little	Moderately	A little	Moderately	Moderately	A little	A little	Not at all	Not at all	A little	A little (2)	A little (2)	Not at all (1)	Not at all (1)	Not at all (1)	A little (2)	Not at all (1)	Not at all (1)	A little (2)	Not at all (1)	A little (2)	Moderately (3)	Not at all (1)	Not at all (1)	Moderately (3)	A little (2)	Moderately (3)	A little (2)	A little (2)	Not at all (1)	32	Male		14 minutes 52 seconds
